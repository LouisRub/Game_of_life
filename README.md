## Game of Life Documentation
### Description

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. It is a zero-player game that simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on a set of rules.

### Rules of the Game
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
